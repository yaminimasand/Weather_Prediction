# Weather Prediction

Description
---
A weather prediction model is a computational tool used to forecast future weather conditions based on the analysis of atmospheric data. The model simulates the physical and dynamic processes occurring in the atmosphere, oceans, and land surface to predict variables such as temperature and humidity. By utilizing initial data from weather observations, these models apply mathematical equations and algorithms to produce forecasts ranging from a few hours to several days or weeks into the future. Weather prediction models are essential for informing the public, guiding agricultural practices, planning transportation and logistics, and preparing for severe weather events.
