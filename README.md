# Weather Prediction

Description
---
The Weather Prediction Model using machine learning is a powerful tool designed to forecast current weather conditions by analyzing temperature and humidity data. By leveraging advanced algorithms, the model learns from historical weather patterns and data to accurately predict whether it will be sunny, cloudy, rainy, or other weather conditions. The model processes input data on current temperature and humidity levels, applies trained machine learning algorithms, and outputs a reliable weather forecast. This predictive capability is essential for various applications, including agriculture, event planning, and daily personal activities, providing users with timely and accurate weather information.
